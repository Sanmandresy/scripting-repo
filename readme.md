# Scripts

1. If you're using Linux OS then you should use command line to execute **renfile.sh** :

```sh
sh renfile.sh
```

* Make sure that the **script** is in the directory where the file(s) you want to rename is/are.

* To see where you are use :

```sh
 pwd
```

2. If you're using Windows OS then you just have to double click **renfile.bat**  or open your *CMD* and type in the file name : 

```sh
  renfile.bat
```

* Make sure that the **script** is in the directory where the file(s) you want to rename is/are ğŸ˜‰ .
